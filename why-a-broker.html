    <h1 style="text-align:center">10 REASONS TO USE A MORTGAGE BROKER</h1>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <h3> <span class="black-numbers">1.</span> Saves You Time and Money- One Stop Shop!</h3>
        <p>
          It could take weeks for you to organize appointments with competing mortgage lenders, and I know you'd probably rather spend your time house-hunting. Instead, let me do all that work for you! I work directly with dozens of lenders, and can quickly narrow
          down a list of those that suit your specific needs best. It makes the entire mortgage process fast, easy, and convenient.

        <h3> <span class="black-numbers">2.</span> Access To Lender Discounts, Promotional Rates, and Industry Advice
        </h3>
        <p>
          At Pegasus Mortgages we are always updated on industry trends, lender discounts, rate reductions, and promotions. I can use this information to get you the best product for the best rate possible.

        </p>

        <h3> <span class="black-numbers">3.</span> I Work For You and Not The Bank</h3>
        <p>
          As an independent mortgage broker I’m not tied to any one lender or range of products. My goal is to help you successfully finance your home or property. I do not work for any particular bank or lender. When you deal directly with a bank they have the
          interest of their institution at heart, whereas I have my client's best interest at heart!
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3> <span class="black-numbers">4.</span> No Cost To You</h3>
        <p>
          There's absolutely no charge to my clients for services on typical residential mortgage transactions. How do I make money? Like many other professional services, mortgage brokers are generally paid a finder’s fee when we introduce trustworthy, dependable
          customers to a financial institution. These fees are quite standard and nearly industry-wide so that my focus remains on you, the customer.

        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3> <span class="black-numbers">5.</span> Single Credit Check Means Healthy Credit</h3>
        <p>
          If you want to shop around to different banks in order to find the best mortgage product, each bank will require a separate credit check. Every credit check that is taken hurts your credit score. Better credit scores allow you to get better mortgage products
          and better rates so you want the strongest credit possible when applying for a mortgage. Alternatively, I only require 1 credit check and can use that report with any lender, or as many lenders as I need. I can therefore shop around for the
          best mortgage product possible while only obtaining 1 credit check, thus keeping your credit score as healthy as possible.

        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3> <span class="black-numbers">6.</span> Flexible Scheduling</h3>
        <p>
          Monday-Friday 9am-5pm does not exist for me. While working directly with banks you often have to bend your schedule in order to meet theirs. This means only being able to talk or meet at the specific bank branch during regular banking hours. As a mortgage
          agent I am available to you whenever you need it. Whether it be 9am-5pm, after typical business hours, or on weekends, I can alter my schedule to fit yours. Also, if you would rather meet somewhere other than Pegasus Mortgages and Financial
          Solutions I can always meet you at your home or another agreed upon location.

        </p>

        <h3> <span class="black-numbers">7.</span> We Negotiate For You With Our Knowledge and Experience!</h3>
        <p>
          Many people are uncertain or uncomfortable negotiating mortgages directly with their bank. Mortgage Brokers negotiate mortgages each and every day on behalf of Canadian homebuyers. You can count on my market knowledge to secure competitive rates and terms
          that benefit you.

        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3> <span class="black-numbers">8.</span> FSCO Licensed</h3>
        <p>
          I am fully licensed and in good standing with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO). Banks are not required to have their mortgage specialists FSCO licenced, and are therefore not held to the same guidelines. FSCO's legislative mandate is
          to provide regulatory services that protect the public interest and enhance public confidence in the sectors it regulates. Being fully licensed means I have met specific education, experience and suitability requirements.

        </p>

        <h3> <span class="black-numbers">9.</span> Ongoing Support & Consultation</h3>
        <p>
          Even once your mortgage is signed and paperwork is complete, I am here if you need any advice on closing details or even future financial needs. I am happy to be of assistance whenever you need it.

        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3> <span class="black-numbers">10.</span> Private, Personal, Confidential and Professional</h3>
        <p>
          As a mortgage professional I guarantee that all information disclosed by my clients are kept private and confidential at all times. I fully respect that the information given to me by my clients is extremely personal and it is my priority that this information
          stays protected and secured.
