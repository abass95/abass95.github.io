                <h3>Purchase</h3>
                <p>
                    Looking to purchase a home? Instead of visiting multiple banks where they are only able to sell you
                    their
                    specific mortgage products, let us do the shopping for you. We have access to a large number of
                    lenders
                    that sell a variety of products. We have strong relationships with these lenders which enable us to
                    receive perks such as lower interest rates, special promotional products, and faster approvals. Let
                    us do
                    the work for you! And it doesn’t cost you a penny!
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Mortgage Pre-Approval</h3>
                <p>
                    When you’re looking to purchase a property a mortgage pre-approval is often a smart idea. A pre-
                    approval will allow you to be pre-approved by a lender for up to a certain amount of money before
                    you
                    even start looking for properties. This way you know exactly how much money you qualify for. A pre-
                    approval will lock in your rate for 120 days so it allows you to take advantage of good rates
                    without the
                    risk of rates going up. If rates go up during the 120 days, your mortgage would remain at the lower
                    locked-in rate. If rates drop within that time frame, then lenders will generally honor the lower
                    rate. So
                    it’s really a win-win!
                </p>

                <h3>Refinance</h3>
                <p>
                    Refinancing your mortgage means you are getting a new mortgage to replace your existing one. Why
                    would someone want to do this? Well one reason is if someone wants to capitalize on lower interest
                    rates thus decreasing the interest rate they are paying on their loan. A second reason is that
                    someone
                    wants to take out equity (cash) from their home for another purchase, renovations, or other
                    opportunities. Another reason is that someone wants to consolidate other debts (credit card, line
                    of
                    credit, car payment) into one debt (your mortgage) so that they are paying less interest, or
                    lowering
                    their overall monthly payment. Whatever the reason may be, refinancing your mortgage can be a great
                    option for many homeowners. Unsure if a refinance can help you? Feel free to contact me so that I
                    can
                    help you determine if a refinance makes sense for you.

                <h3>Switch/Transfer</h3>
                <p>
                    A switch mortgage or transfer mortgage involves moving your current mortgage from one lender to
                    another without changing anything except the term and interest rate. A switch is beneficial when
                    you

                    want to take advantage of lower rates in the market without changing any other aspect of your
                    mortgage. Within the term, there will be a penalty for breaking the mortgage, though often the
                    savings
                    in moving to another lender with a better rate will substantially outweigh the penalty. Doing a
                    switch at
                    the end of your mortgage term will allow you to completely avoid the penalty. Unsure of how much
                    you
                    can save, what your penalty will be, and if it’s all worth it? Feel free to contact me and I will
                    break
                    everything down for you.

                <h3>Home Equity Line of Credit</h3>
                <p>
                    A Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is a revolving line of credit that enables you to borrow from
                    the
                    equity in your home. As you pay off your mortgage and as your property appreciates you are able to
                    take this money out at an interest rate that is much lower than traditional lines of credit. You
                    are only
                    charged interest on your HELOC for the portion that you use, similar to a traditional line of
                    credit.
                    Therefore if you take out a $200,000 HELOC, but are only using $50,000, you are only charged
                    interest
                    on the $50,000.

                    no
                    money? If you are unable to prove income, there is still an opportunity for you to obtain a
                    mortgage if
                    you have equity in your current home, or a large down payment. Feel free to contact me and I’ll
                    tell you
