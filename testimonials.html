        <h3> Michael and Laura </h3>
        <p>
          "Anthony came highly recommended from a good friend of ours at the time of purchase of our first home. 
          Anthony was easy to talk to, incredibly knowledgeable, and quick to get things rolling. 
          Not to mention, he was able to let us know of the best rates and listened to our needs to help us identify and secure the best rate and a mortgage that fit our needs. 
          Being first time homebuyers, we really didn’t know much about the process but he was always easily reachable, giving us guidance, recommendations and explaining everything step by step. 
          Anthony made sure to keep us updated, and explained next steps in advance, which allowed us to be fully prepared with all information and documents needed, in order to speed up the process - our mortgage closed quickly and without any issues. 
          Anthony made the whole process very easy, always had time to answer questions, and was willing to take the time to teach us exactly what we needed to know. 
          After the deal closed, Anthony has continued to check in with us, keeping us updated of market changes, and seeing if we needed any support given current events and ongoing economic developments. 
          We highly recommend Anthony and are grateful for all of his support!"

          “We were referred to Anthony by a very close friend that is also our Relator. 
          We were in the beginning of the process to buy our first home when we were caught in the middle of the COVID19 pandemic. 
          Everything went crazy and that is when we found Anthony, who literally saved us! 
          He is a very knowledgeable, patient and trustworthy professional. 
          He was able to find a deal that was perfect for us and worked intensively on all the details. 
          As immigrants and first time home buyers we had many questions but he was always available to give us all the attention and quick feedback during the entire process. 
          Anthony really took care of us and helped us make a dream come true. Thank you!!”

        <p>
          “I was working with another mortgage broker when I put a deposit down on a new property. 
          After my broker was not being responsive enough for my liking, I was recommended to Anthony from a family member. 
          Anthony was extremely responsive and was able to get me a better rate at a better lender than the broker who I’d been working with originally. 
          I made the switch to Anthony and never looked back! 
          The property closed without any issues and Anthony was there with me every step of the way. 
          Since then Anthony has always been available for help, guidance, and to answer any questions I have about my current mortgage as well as new opportunities. 
          When my mortgage was up for renewal recently, Anthony explained a bunch of different options I had at the time, and we picked the best option available which I was very happy with. 
          Anthony has been my trusted mortgage specialist since we were introduced, and I look forward to him guiding me though my real estate goals in the future.”

        <p>
          “I was introduced to Anthony by a colleague of mine. 
          I was a first- time home buyer and didn’t really know where to begin (how much I qualified for, what the proper steps were etc). 
          After speaking with Anthony he laid out all the steps for me, collected my documents, and discussed a number of different options for me. 
          After some strategizing Anthony got me a pre-approval at a lender that was offering a great rate and product. 
          During the house hunt we communicated regularly, often well into the evening/ weekends since I worked throughout the day. 
          After looking at a bunch of properties I decided to purchase a new-build condo. 
          Anthony helped me get approved for the pre-build and I’m excited to be moving into the property soon. 
          Anthony was extremely informative and helpful throughout the entire process. 
          He helped guide me in this new process, and was available whenever I needed him. Highly recommended!”

        <h3> Laura </h3>
        <p>
          “I recently purchased another property and Anthony Basciano was my trusted mortgage broker. 
          His knowledge, insight, resourcefulness, professionalism, advocacy and understanding of how I wanted to approach this process were helpful and bar none. 
          If you are considering buying a property, he is your guy. 
          He secured me an all-time low rate and worked with me through the entire process. Thanks agent Bas!”

        <h3> Ares </h3>
        <p>
          “I’m a realtor who was introduced to Anthony a number of years ago. 
          Since then we have shared a number of clients. 
          During the deals process I have noticed Anthony is very Hands-On and takes responsibility for his role in every transaction. 
          He has worked closely with both first time home buyers and with more experienced purchasers and his step-by-step approach is greatly appreciated. 
          I would recommend a meeting with Anthony to review your financing options.”
